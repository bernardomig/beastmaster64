       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

\" police xxunk 's lowe , all right \" xxmaj tom xxunk low , right down by the floor ! \" police xxunk i get on ? \" xxmaj tom xxunk 's dead , but knock yourself out \" xxup mst3 k is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer .,xxbos i have seen it . xxmaj it 's not \" good \" but interesting in an understated way . xxmaj the boys in it are quite naturalistic but xxrep 16 . the graphic / gratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and -oh yes- the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance . xxmaj real atrocity is xxunk this film is just atrocious . xxmaj however , the film has a look which can draw you in . xxmaj but it seems to me that is the \" xxmaj emperor 's xxmaj new xxmaj clothes \" , but in fact in reverse . xxmaj the film looks good , but the direction , story , content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous . xxmaj if a feeling can be vacuous - this is it .,xxbos xxmaj and i repeat , please do not see this movie ! xxmaj this is more than a review . xxmaj this is a warning . xxmaj this sets the record for the worst , most effortless comedy ever made . xxmaj at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays , the gags are crude and flat , but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny . i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite xxunk : xxmaj everyone thinks they can do comedy , and only 10 percent of them are right . xxmaj comedy is hard ! xxmaj this is not some genre any fool can play around with . i think it 's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to \" xxmaj kentucky xxmaj fried xxmaj movie . \" xxmaj basically , these bozos are comparing their so - called comic talents to those of the brilliant xxmaj jim xxmaj abrahams and the xxmaj zucker xxmaj brothers . xxmaj come on , i 've seen xxmaj pauly xxmaj shore movies that are 10 times funnier than \" xxmaj the xxmaj underground xxmaj comedy xxmaj movie . \" xxmaj here 's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie : xxmaj one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen . xxmaj that 's it . xxmaj that 's the whole joke . xxmaj wow . xxmaj this is enough to make xxmaj carrot xxmaj top roll his eyes . xxmaj another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie . xxmaj and in another sketch , there 's a bag lady beauty contest , in which we 're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini - clad middle - aged women with beer guts and stretch marks . xxmaj plus , making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny . xxmaj it 's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped . xxmaj the whole movie is supposed to be a satire . i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire ... is xxup truth ! ! ! xxmaj for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap , explain to me what is truthful about xxup any of these gags ! xxmaj some of the sketches might 've sounded funny on paper , but anybody who 's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper , it probably wo n't be funny on screen . xxmaj if i tell someone about a big , black , muscular gay virgin , who 's saving himself for the right man , he or she would probably laugh . xxmaj but watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag . i hate how whenever people criticize a low - brow comedy like this for not being funny , they 're regarded as stuck - up squares . i just saw \" xxmaj white xxmaj chicks \" recently . xxmaj that 's another low - brow , politically incorrect comedy , but i laughed my head off . xxmaj the most offensive thing about \" xxmaj the xxmaj underground xxmaj comedy xxmaj movie \" is it 's not funny ! xxmaj what the writers and directors do n't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless does n't work . xxmaj there has to be more ! xxmaj just think of the famous scene from \" xxmaj there 's xxmaj something xxmaj about xxmaj mary \" ( ironically , enough the bozo filmmakers put the xxmaj farrellys on their special thanks list ) . xxmaj the joke about the semen was n't just funny because it involved bodily fluids . xxmaj there was a buildup . xxmaj ben xxmaj stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he did n't go out on a date with a \" loaded gun . \" xxmaj then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released . a knock is on the door , and he has to answer it . xxmaj his date , xxmaj mary , is at the door and that 's when it 's revealed that the semen is hanging off xxmaj ben 's ear . xxmaj in this movie , there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people , with no buildup whatsoever . xxmaj as xxmaj jay xxmaj leno always says , \" xxmaj this comedy thing 's not so easy , is it ? \" xxmaj keep that in mind , xxmaj vince xxmaj offer , 'cause you were n't cut out for this genre ! ! xxmaj the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip . xxmaj let 's face it , nowadays it 's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect . i know comedy is subjective ... but this movie should n't be funny to anybody , except maybe the filmmakers themselves . xxmaj as a side note , the movie had to have been made before xxmaj michael xxmaj clarke xxmaj duncan 's fame in movies like \" xxmaj armageddon \" and \" xxmaj the xxmaj green xxmaj mile . \" xxmaj there ca n't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show . xxmaj all the others in the cast are either non - actors , has - been actors or b - movie stars . xxmaj karen xxmaj black made a good impression in \" xxmaj five xxmaj easy xxmaj pieces , \" but i do n't think she 's done anything of value ever since . xxmaj slash was probably drugged into being in this film . xxmaj gina xxmaj lee xxmaj xxunk is nothing without \" xxmaj baywatch . \" xxmaj xxunk is the film 's biggest star ( keeping in mind xxmaj duncan was n't famous at the time ) , and there are still probably a ton of people who have n't heard of her -- for good reason . xxmaj usually , i 'm in support of extremely low - budget flicks , but this one deserves to drift into obscurity . i hope to xxmaj lord this does n't become a cult classic ! xxmaj should n't there be a law against distributing crap like this ?\n",

\" police xxunk 's lowe , all right \" xxmaj tom xxunk low , right down by the floor ! \" police xxunk i get on ? \" xxmaj tom xxunk 's dead , but knock yourself out \" xxup mst3 k is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer .,xxbos i have seen it . xxmaj it 's not \" good \" but interesting in an understated way . xxmaj the boys in it are quite naturalistic but xxrep 16 . the graphic / gratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and -oh yes- the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance . xxmaj real atrocity is xxunk this film is just atrocious . xxmaj however , the film has a look which can draw you in . xxmaj but it seems to me that is the \" xxmaj emperor 's xxmaj new xxmaj clothes \" , but in fact in reverse . xxmaj the film looks good , but the direction , story , content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous . xxmaj if a feeling can be vacuous - this is it .,xxbos xxmaj and i repeat , please do not see this movie ! xxmaj this is more than a review . xxmaj this is a warning . xxmaj this sets the record for the worst , most effortless comedy ever made . xxmaj at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays , the gags are crude and flat , but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny . i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite xxunk : xxmaj everyone thinks they can do comedy , and only 10 percent of them are right . xxmaj comedy is hard ! xxmaj this is not some genre any fool can play around with . i think it 's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to \" xxmaj kentucky xxmaj fried xxmaj movie . \" xxmaj basically , these bozos are comparing their so - called comic talents to those of the brilliant xxmaj jim xxmaj abrahams and the xxmaj zucker xxmaj brothers . xxmaj come on , i 've seen xxmaj pauly xxmaj shore movies that are 10 times funnier than \" xxmaj the xxmaj underground xxmaj comedy xxmaj movie . \" xxmaj here 's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie : xxmaj one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen . xxmaj that 's it . xxmaj that 's the whole joke . xxmaj wow . xxmaj this is enough to make xxmaj carrot xxmaj top roll his eyes . xxmaj another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie . xxmaj and in another sketch , there 's a bag lady beauty contest , in which we 're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini - clad middle - aged women with beer guts and stretch marks . xxmaj plus , making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny . xxmaj it 's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped . xxmaj the whole movie is supposed to be a satire . i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire ... is xxup truth ! ! ! xxmaj for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap , explain to me what is truthful about xxup any of these gags ! xxmaj some of the sketches might 've sounded funny on paper , but anybody who 's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper , it probably wo n't be funny on screen . xxmaj if i tell someone about a big , black , muscular gay virgin , who 's saving himself for the right man , he or she would probably laugh . xxmaj but watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag . i hate how whenever people criticize a low - brow comedy like this for not being funny , they 're regarded as stuck - up squares . i just saw \" xxmaj white xxmaj chicks \" recently . xxmaj that 's another low - brow , politically incorrect comedy , but i laughed my head off . xxmaj the most offensive thing about \" xxmaj the xxmaj underground xxmaj comedy xxmaj movie \" is it 's not funny ! xxmaj what the writers and directors do n't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless does n't work . xxmaj there has to be more ! xxmaj just think of the famous scene from \" xxmaj there 's xxmaj something xxmaj about xxmaj mary \" ( ironically , enough the bozo filmmakers put the xxmaj farrellys on their special thanks list ) . xxmaj the joke about the semen was n't just funny because it involved bodily fluids . xxmaj there was a buildup . xxmaj ben xxmaj stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he did n't go out on a date with a \" loaded gun . \" xxmaj then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released . a knock is on the door , and he has to answer it . xxmaj his date , xxmaj mary , is at the door and that 's when it 's revealed that the semen is hanging off xxmaj ben 's ear . xxmaj in this movie , there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people , with no buildup whatsoever . xxmaj as xxmaj jay xxmaj leno always says , \" xxmaj this comedy thing 's not so easy , is it ? \" xxmaj keep that in mind , xxmaj vince xxmaj offer , 'cause you were n't cut out for this genre ! ! xxmaj the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip . xxmaj let 's face it , nowadays it 's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect . i know comedy is subjective ... but this movie should n't be funny to anybody , except maybe the filmmakers themselves . xxmaj as a side note , the movie had to have been made before xxmaj michael xxmaj clarke xxmaj duncan 's fame in movies like \" xxmaj armageddon \" and \" xxmaj the xxmaj green xxmaj mile . \" xxmaj there ca n't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show . xxmaj all the others in the cast are either non - actors , has - been actors or b - movie stars . xxmaj karen xxmaj black made a good impression in \" xxmaj five xxmaj easy xxmaj pieces , \" but i do n't think she 's done anything of value ever since . xxmaj slash was probably drugged into being in this film . xxmaj gina xxmaj lee xxmaj xxunk is nothing without \" xxmaj baywatch . \" xxmaj xxunk is the film 's biggest star ( keeping in mind xxmaj duncan was n't famous at the time ) , and there are still probably a ton of people who have n't heard of her -- for good reason . xxmaj usually , i 'm in support of extremely low - budget flicks , but this one deserves to drift into obscurity . i hope to xxmaj lord this does n't become a cult classic ! xxmaj should n't there be a law against distributing crap like this ?\n",

       "xxbos i did n't know what to expect when i started watching this movie , by the end of it i was pulling my hairs out . xxmaj this was one of the most pathetic movies of this year ... in fact , in the last ten years . xxmaj david xxmaj dhawan should just give up his career as a director . i am yet to come across one original script that xxmaj david xxmaj dhawan has worked on . xxmaj this one was a complete bit y bit rip off xxmaj hitch . i have nothing against remakes as such , but this one is just so lousy that it makes you even hate the original one ( which was pretty decent ) . i fail to understand what actors like xxmaj salman and xxmaj govinda saw in this script . i read somewhere , that this was supposed to be xxmaj govinda 's comeback vehicle . xxmaj if that s true , then only xxmaj god can save his career . xxmaj salman just overacted to the hilt . xxmaj govinda who i think is an actor of very high caliber was completely wasted . xxmaj katrina xxmaj kaif and lara xxmaj dutta had nothing to do apart form wearing designer clothes and smiling for no rhyme or reason . xxmaj please stay away form this one !,xxbos xxmaj for several reasons , this movie is simply awful . xxmaj other posters have listed some of this movie 's historical errors . xxmaj well , i have a layman 's knowledge of xxmaj roman history and even i found the inaccuracies flagrant . i usually forgive errors in historical movies because i understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate . xxmaj and shrinking a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some , let 's say , historical license . xxmaj but this movie goes well beyond mere rounding . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj there 's worse . xxmaj to tell a story from a distant period , the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing . xxmaj unless viewers have some prior knowledge of the period , they will quickly be lost . xxmaj in addition , the movie was obviously filmed simultaneously in xxmaj italian and xxmaj english with various actors being dubbed later . xxmaj at times , the actors seem as if they were in completely different movies which were then edited together . xxmaj in fact , this is not far wrong . xxmaj the actors were obviously pasted onto a cheesy computer generated ancient xxmaj rome . \n",
