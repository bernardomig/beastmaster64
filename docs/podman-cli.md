Uau, that is a lot of commands!!! Let us begin with each command in a step by set way.

## Working with images

### Searching for an image

As discussed before, in order to run a container, it is required to first define the image which will be the blueprint for the image. Podman has a `search` command in order to find images in the registries.

For example, if we want to find the `ubuntu` image:

```
podman search ubuntu
```

This will provide a long list of images that match `ubuntu`. The first image, marked as official, looks promising: `docker.io/library/ubuntu`.

### Pulling the image

Now, in order to use the image, we need to download it, or, in container terms, `pull` it from the registry. This will ensure that the image is present in the host machine.

```
podman pull docker.io/library/ubuntu
```

### Listing images

What are the images present on the host? The `images` command lists all images on the host.

```
podman images
```

### Pushing a image

An image present in the host machine can be pushed to a registry with the `push` command, similarly to the `pull` command.

```
podman push ubuntu <registry>/<image>
```

## Working with containers

### Creating a new container

To create a new container, we can use the `run` command.

```
podman run ubuntu
```

What? Nothing happened? Yeah. The container started but because no command was specified, it immediately stopped. We can see the stopped container with the `podman ps -a` command.

Let us run again with a command now.

```bash
podman run ubuntu echo "I'm a container"
```

This time, the container outputs `I'm a container`, indicating that the `echo` actually run.

Now, we want to run a container has an interactive session:

```bash
podman run -it ubuntu
```

The `run` command is very powerful, and can be greatly customized by it's option flags. The most useful and known ones are:

- `--name`: sets the name of the container.
- `--rm`: remove the container after it has stopped.
- `-it`: attach a terminal to the container, in order to start an interactive container.
- `-v`: maps a directory from the host to the container. For example: `-v ~/workspace/package1:/workspace/package1`.
- `-p`: maps a port from the host to the container. For example: `-p 8080:80`.
- `-e`: define a environment variable inside the container.
- `-d`: run the container in background (detach from current terminal).
- `--cpus`: define the number of cpus available in the container.

### Listing running container

To list the running containers, use the command `ps`. If we instead want to see the stopped containers as well, add the `-a` flag.

```
podman ps
```

### Stop running container

To stop a running container, use the command `stop`. The id or the name of the container is required, which can be seen with the `ps` command.

```
podman stop <container>
```

### Removing a container

To delete a container, use the command `rm`. Deleting a container deletes all state that was created in the container.

```
podman rm <container>
```

### Commiting a container

To save the current container state as a image, use the `commit` command.

```
podman commit <container> <image>
```

## Building images with Dockerfile

Podman can build images with the Dockerfile specification (see [this](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)), using the `build` command.

```
podman build --tag <image> <Dockerfile>
```
