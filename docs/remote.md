## SSH

Secure Shell, or `SSH`, allows a communication between the local computer and a remote host. This connection is highly useful, as it can create remote shells, share files and create tcp tunnels between the two computers. The most basic command creates a remote shell:

```bash
ssh ${USER}@${HOST}
# Now we are executing commands on the other computer
```

The following are a bunch of commands that are useful when working on a remote shell:

#### Login through ssh keys instead of password

It is possible to login through a pair of cryptographic keys, instead of a password. This is more secure and more practical, because it is not required to enter the password at each new connection. To activate this, execute this commands:

```bash
# Generate the cryptographic key pair
ssh-keygen
# Copy the public key to the remote computer
ssh-copy-id user@remote
```

A more detailed explanation on this protocol can be found [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/#sec-Automate-with-SSH-keys-but-manage-them) and [here](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work)

#### Define custom hosts

It can be quite cumbersome to configure the same host repeatedly with the `ssh` command. To overcome this, it is possible to configure the hosts in the ssh configuration. To to so, add the lines to the `.ssh/config` for each host:

```
Host beast
    Hostname beastmaster64.web.dem.ua.pt
    Port     22
    User     my.self
```

#### Port Forwarding

The port forwarding makes it possible to share a port between the two computers, through the ssh connection. To do so, a `-L` option can be configured. For example, to open a connection to my-server and forward any connection to port 8080 to the port 80 of the server, the command should be:

```
ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 my-server
```

A more detailed explanation can be found in [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/example).

## SCP

SCP allows files to be copied between different hosts. It uses ssh for data transfer and provides the same authentication and same level of security as ssh. For example, to copy the file `foobar.txt` from a remote host to the local host:

```bash
scp your_username@remotehost.edu:foobar.txt /some/local/directory
```

Further information about SCP can be found [here](http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php).

## rsync

Rsync, which stands for "remote sync", is a remote and local file synchronization tool. It uses an algorithm that minimizes the amount of data copied by only moving the portions of files that have changed. This can be useful during development to synchronize the code between the local computer (used for development) and the remote host (used for execution). For example, to synchronize two directories in the host/remote, we can use the command:

```bash
rsync -a username@remote_host:/home/username/dir1 place_to_sync_on_local_machine
```

Some useful options that can be used in this command is:

* `--delete`. By default, the `rsync` does not delete any file. To force it to delete the files, if deleted, use this flag.
* `-z`. Compresses the files for transfer. Can improve syncing times and bandwidth.
* `-v`. Shows a verbose output, useful to inspect which files were sync'd.
